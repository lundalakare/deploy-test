# deploy-test-frontend

This is a demo frontend made using Nuxt.js. It was generated with `npx
create-nuxt-app`.

In `plugins/config.js` you'll find a piece of code that loads the environment
variables defined in `nuxt.config.js`, and if in production, also from the
endpoint `/config.js`.

You'll also find the file `plugins/axios.js`. This small plugin configures the
base URL for Axios from the previously loaded config.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Follow the instructions below
